# REVIEW

### Data Structures covered in this Course

- Basic Array
- Singly Linked List 
- Queue (using Linked-List)
- Stack (using Linked-List)
- ArrayList a.k.a Growable-Array
- RingBuffer (aka An Array that can grow from both ends)
- Doubly-Linked List
- Generic Linked-List in C
- Binary Tree
- Generic Binary Tree in C
- Binary Search Tree
- Priority Queue
- Trie      (A type of tree used for strings and caches)
- HashMap     (Not generic because generics in C requires some magic and I'm no magician)
- LRU (aka Least Recently Used) (Geared toward caching and such) (Combines List and HashMap)

### Algorithms

- Array Linear Search
- Array Binary Search
- Array Bubble Sort
- Two Crystal Ball Algorithm (Array)
- Path Finding Maze (Recursion and dynamic programming)
- QuickSort
- Depth First Search for Binary Tree
- Breath First Search for Binary Tree
- Heapify Up
- Heapify Down
- Delete a node in a Binary Search Tree (unexpectedly complicated)
- Breath First Search for walking a Graph that uses Adjacency Matrix
- Depth First Search for walking a Graph that uses Adjacency **List**
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Hashing a HashMap

### What did I learn

- Priotity queue is a really useful DS
- A Ring Buffer (aka VecDeque) is possibly even more useful in more scenarios
- Implementing Data Structures in C is massively helpful for understanding how it works under the hood
- C is very nice and simple to code in when you really understand your product like Data Structures but it gets really complex quickly 
- once you start wanting to do more complicated stuff which modern languages features help tremendously
- Binary Search Trees are very useful for seaching and stuff
- When in doubt just use a HashMap when it comes to coding challenges with limiting time complexity
- Noticing when all these Data Structures and Algorithm fit your use case is very important
- When in a coding interview try to think about which datastructure would make the problem much easier to solve
